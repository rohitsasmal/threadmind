Threadmind manual

There are 2 types of pages.
1. Root(/)
2. Message(/<messageId>)

The root or home page displays the global set of 'threads'
The <messageId> page has certain behavior depending on the current message type.

There are 4 types of nodes.
1. ROOT
2. USER
3. BOTEDIT
4. BOT


There is only 1 ROOT per 'thread tree'.
USER: User prompts
BOTEDIT: User edited bot responses. Interpreted as 'Expected bot response'
BOT: Generated BOT message which takes as input the entire path from root to the current User prompt.
The levels follow
ROOT->USER->(BOT/BOTEDIT)->(USER)->(BOT/BOTEDIT)....

The 'Generate' button appears ONLY on USER levels.
Clicking Generate will produce a bot response(Currently lorem ipsum gibberish) as a Child of the current USER node.
Generating bot response will also freeze all nodes from root to the current USER node and the newly created BOT node.
This is so that generated bot responses remain 'frozen' along with their path.
New edits may be added at any point in the path by simply adding new nodes. Currently needs an explicit copy paste.

The path section shows path until current node. Aids navigation.
Go To parent and Go to home also aid nav.
